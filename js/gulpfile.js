// Outside of the above required plugins, you'll also need to download either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick. The links are on the quiz page. I chose to use GraphicsMagick, but either will work. Just download the installer file for your OS, and let it install. You won't need it to show in any code, it just has to be on your computer.
